# Bezier Curve Animation

This project demonstrates the animation of a Bezier curve and its derivative (tangent).
You can view the animation at https://feldragon5.github.io/Bezier-Curve-Animation/

## Usage

-   Click and drag the four control points to change the shape of the Bezier curve.
-   The tangent line will animate along the curve, showing the derivative along the curve.

## Expansion Ideas

-   **Add More Control Points**: Allow users to add more control points to create more complex curves.
-   **Color Customization**: Provide options to change the colors of the curve, control points, and tangent line.
-   **Dark Mode**: Add a light/dark mode toggle.
-   **Mathematical Display**: Show the mathematical equations of the Bezier curve and its derivative.
-   **Animation Speed Control**: Allow users to adjust the speed of the tangent line animation.
